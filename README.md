# PV168 Project: TODO List

The desktop application will help with organizing events. The event should tell what should to do, the location, when is
the due time, and what is the estimated time for the event. There are also categories of events. You can also filter the
events.

## How we work

### GIT LOGIC

#### Overall work

We use milestones. We contribute to branch ``dev`` till the milestone is over. We open MR to master. After it is
reviewed by our **incredibly intelligent, know-it-all PM Ondra**, the ``dev`` branch is merged into master.

#### Merge process of individual developers

Dev makes a branch from ``dev`` branch. He adds some code and when he added some functionality which is working, he
opens a MR to ``dev``.
(Preferably, merge requests should be small, so it is easier to understand and review)
Dev assigns other three devs to his MR. Dev waits for reviews. At least two other devs are required for MR to be merged.
When MR is opened for some time without sufficient response from other dev. MR owner should ping others on Messenger.

Commit messages looks like this: "GUI: Added filter for Events"

Draft MR sign means that MR is still in progress, but review is welcome.

## Notes
This project was developed during Fall semester 2023 as a team project. 
We used GitLab to make Merge Requests, code reviews and track issues - unfortunetelly It did not carry on during the rebase to GitHub.
